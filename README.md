Officially named by me as "Silver Rush", this project is a small top-down 2D game written in C with the help of the graphical library [`minilibx`](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux).
It is intended to be compiled and played in a Linux based operating system running the [X11](https://x.org/wiki/) windowing system.

# Instructions

You start the game at 5 HP (Health Points), and you are *poisoned right form the start*. Each step taken causes you to lose one health point, meaning that you need to consider each step wisely. Throughout the map are spread various *antidote collectibles* that you need to collect in order to reset your HP back to 5. Also, you need to get all the collectibles in order to be able to open the exit, so good luck managing to get all of them and get to the exit alive!
