Officially named by me as "Silver Rush", this project is a small top-down 2D game written in C with the help of the graphical library [`minilibx`](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux).
It is intended to be compiled and played in a Linux based operating system running the [X11](https://x.org/wiki/) windowing system.

(This is still "in beta" since I still need to polish some things but expect updates soon.)
